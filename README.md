# blot

Blot is a plotting library written in C (with a C++ wrapper), that plots data onto a string buffer.

That's right, there are no images, just text -- see examples below.

## Noteworthy features

  * plots to the console as text (by calling `puts()`)
  * very very fast (compared to python alternatives)
  * very very memory usage friendly
  * can plot multiple datasets on one canvas
  * uses familiar figure based API (similar to existing python plotting frameworks)
  * supports braille plotting (like [plotille](https://github.com/tammoippen/plotille))
  * 256 colour support
  * data arrays can be provided in various types (`int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `double`, or `float`)
  * there is a C++ wrapper, for convenience

## Prerequisites

`blot` is developed on NixOS and Debian, and CI tested on Debian and Ubuntu.
It is built using standard tools. The dependency script will install the
required packages if you're on a Debian-based distro.

    ./dependencies.sh

Packages that `blot` needs: `make` `ninja` `cmake` `glib2` `googletest`.

## Building

`blot` is built using `cmake` and `ninja`.  There is a top level `Makefile` only to
simplify the build process (it invokes `cmake` in the `build` subdirectory).

    make

You can build debug (with `ASAN`) using

    make TYPE=Debug

## Examples

`blot` is being used in other projects as a library, but it comes with some
examples.

Generated from [simple.c](examples/c/c-simple.c) (see also [simple.cpp](examples/cpp/cpp-simple.cpp) for C++ wrapper usage)

    ./build/examples/c/c-simple

Generated from [trig.c](examples/c/c-trig.c) (see also [trig.cpp](examples/cpp/cpp-trig.cpp) for C++ wrapper usage)

    ./build/examples/c/c-trig

## Missing features

  * different plotting modes like histograms (currently only plots line/scatter/bar)
  * improve axis line and numbering (currently not very accurate)
  * add axis labels and minor ticks (configurable)
  * draw origin lines and minor tick lines (configurable)

### Ideas:

Allow for swapping data from layer to allow for even faster plotting (allow `blot` to reuse existing allocated structures)
  1. create a figure
  2. all `blot_figure_scatter` multiple times, have it return the `blot_layer`
  3. call `blot_figure_render` and `blot_screen_get_text`
  4. then use `blot_layer_new_data` to swap the data
  5. repeat from step (3)
